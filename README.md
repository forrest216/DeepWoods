Welcome! This second offering from Forrest Smith is an app for logging and trading your secret mushroom spots with other mushroom(or whatever!) foragers. As always, be careful, bring water, and if you don't find anything don't be sad - you went for a nice hike!

### Browse trades anonymously, or Log in to view your dashboard:

This project has been a long time coming, as foraging is one of my favorite ways to get out to the woods. Coming to the Bay Area, I found precious few spots and had nobody to share with. DeepWoods could be the community that solves that for people like me. Let's fill those baskets!

Deployed using Express/Node.js, MongoDB, Javascript and HTML/CSS with a little help from: [Bulma](https://www.bulma.io)
